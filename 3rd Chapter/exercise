1. investigate std::lock algorithm and implement your version  
2. implement unique_lock, lock_guard your versions --- solved 
3. investigate why std::call_once exists, and investigate implementation and implement your own version 
4. statical declaration in function, with multiple thread, see how it's work 
5. dns implementation with reader-writer mutex's
